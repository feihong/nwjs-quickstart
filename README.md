# Feihong's NW.js Quickstart

A very minimal desktop app built using NW.js. Hot reload is not set up.

## Install

    yarn install

## Run

    yarn start

## Note

You have to install via `yarn add nw@sdk` to get the sdk build, this gives you access to dev tools.

The dev tools shortcut on Mac is actually F12, you have to right-click on the app.

You can right-click and select `Reload App` to restart the app.
